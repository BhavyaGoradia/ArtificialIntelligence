(i have a number of echo\\'s and 2) echo dots in the house). i am completely blown away by echo show!! here is a brief summary of thoughts: likes: 1- substantially the best sound quality of any echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, dolby audio & focused sound field to the front. you can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the echo.2- the 8) far field microphones are more effective than echo. 3- high resolution 7\" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- song lyrics are great! (free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: mute / camera defeat with red on screen indicator; volume up & volume down. 7- excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- auto presence detector turns show screen on when you are detected. 9- speak to alexa, just as with echo or dot, & show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. you also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- say: alexa, show me the \"front porch\", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- video conference - i do not know anyone else with show yet, so i cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- uses the same power supply as amazon echo. 14- sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of show in the center of the desk with 2) 4k monitors & ipad pro). 15- the touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- build quality is first rate! 17- rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- addictive! more than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- see your shopping list. 20- see visual confirmation that the lights you ask alexa to turn on actually turned on. dislikes: none! i would only offer one design option. i would offer an optional amazon echo show wireless subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. it would work like the many soundbars that include a wireless sub. that would allow show to not only rock out, but to shake the walls at the same time!i am seriously planning to sell some echos & dots to pick up a couple more shows. they are great!!',\n",

       " 'the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device. i\\'m not sure if i\\'m missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as san diego zoo elephants) that you can\\'t get on the show. while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. setup was pretty straight forward and easy. it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as \"play\" or \"start\" or \"open\") i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. you would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as i can see. some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, i don\\'t really want to be terrified awake each day. i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you\\'d like. i don\\'t see that yet anywhere. another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times i\\'d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. hoping that works well when it arrives.it will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. all in all i\\'d say it\\'s a good emerging technology but needs a little work. considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago it\\'s kind of where we\\'re heading.',\n",
       " \"alexa show is really well put together. the main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my ring doorbell, and ring floodlights to view on command by alexa on the show screen. yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. the touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the alexa app on your family cell phones. alexa can scan items via upc and order them on amazon, or tell you where to get them. the recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but shown to you. also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (if you use amazon music to play the music). you can ask for a news briefing, and you see the news, highlights, etc. the speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. the sound fills the room nicely. when the echo show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is way more to do with this device!\",\n",

       " \"i have had the echo show for about a month now. so this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you're an amazon prime member, pair your echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (most of these are really easy to set up, so you don't have to be a very technical person.) all of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the alexa app from your smart phone. if you have a friend with an echo show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. as far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. the bing search engine needs some work. if you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an echo show, she's your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. ie; weather forecast, you get whatever bing uses and the short version. if bing would expand their horizons in searches, i would definitely 5 star this item. she does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. i am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. all in all, very fun, helpful, item. it can order you pizza too.\",\n",
